 - Position your product to outperform competitors on the ranked criteria."
1,How do I know if I'm ready to start a business?,"Below are some of the qualities you will need to be successful.

 - Willingness to sacrifice—If you enjoy working the nine to five, do not go into business for yourself. Entrepreneurship often requires many more hours beyond the forty-hour work week.

2,Is a business plan important?,"A business plan is important because it summarizes both your vision for the company and your blueprint for the company’s operating success.

3,"If I am not applying for a bank loan, why do I need a business plan?","The fact that a bank or lending institution requires a well-executed business plan is a secondary consideration. The primary purpose of the business plan is to guide the owner or manager in successfully operating the business. Preparing the plan forces the writer to consider all aspects of the business and to confront any problems the plan highlights. For example, a monthly compilation of all known costs, over time, will indicate the revenue necessary to support these costs, plus a profit. This leads to the question of whether or not this revenue number is reasonable. If not, it may cast doubt on the viability of the venture itself. The business plan is a vital management tool that enables the manager to anticipate situations before they become problems—or worse yet, emergencies."
4,How do I determine my startup costs and other expenses?,"It is wise to find out what startup costs you will incur before starting the business. Many a budding entrepreneur takes his or her life savings, or will borrow on the equity on their home before figuring these financial factors, only to find that they don’t have enough money. There are many web sites and other resources (including SCORE offices and Business Information Centers) that provide guidelines and worksheets to help determine costs for your business. Each item on your proposed budget sheet should be researched. Closely estimated costs can be obtained from utility companies, trade associations, and networking with other business people who may have already gone through this experience. Do not start buying until the investigation shows this venture is viable and you have all the information needed."
5,Why is it important to do a monthly cash-flow analysis?,"Your businesses cash-flow cycle may differ substantially from the income statement projections. Even if the projected income statement shows a profit, it is possible that the cash flow for the same period is actually negative.The analysis of monthly cash flow can indicate whether your business will collect sufficient cash to pay operating expenses. It will point out specific months during the year when the business may experience operating cash shortfalls and, therefore, either require additional capital or excess cash reserves for payment of expenses. It will also show when you may be able to make debt reductions and when there is excess cash to make major purchases or expand operations. By developing a monthly cash flow projection, you can time cash needs and quantify the amount needed."

Capital Structure. 
Dividend Policy. 
New Funds Received. 
Income Tax Rates."
252,Is WACC constant?,"As a company gears up, the decrease in the WACC caused by having a greater amount of cheaper debt is exactly offset by the increase in the WACC caused by the increase in the cost of equity due to financial risk. The WACC remains constant at all levels of gearing thus the market value of the company is also constant."
253,What would increase WACC?,"All sources of capital, including common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and any other long-term debt, are included in a WACC calculation. A firm's WACC increases as the beta and rate of return on equity increase because an increase in WACC denotes a decrease in valuation and an increase in risk."
254,How does the tax rate affect WACC?,"Decisions made by owners or managers can protect income from tax or expose it to tax, affecting the tax rate applied to company profits, which in turn affects the WACC.

Ke = Cost of Equity.

Kd = Cost of Debt.

262,What is the tax rate for WACC?,"Notice in the WACC formula above that the cost of debt is adjusted lower to reflect the company's tax rate. For example, a company with a 10% cost of debt and a 25% tax rate has a cost of debt of 10% x (1-0.25) = 7.5% after the tax adjustment."

"
267,What is WACC and how is it calculated?,"WACC is calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight, and then adding the products together to determine the value. In the above formula, E/V represents the proportion of equity-based financing, while D/V represents the proportion of debt-based financing."
